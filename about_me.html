		<h2>hello, my name is kim. </h2>
		<p>Hello there! My name is Kim! I'm a <strong> 19 year old freshman studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC) </strong>. I am highly interested in working in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence but am still exploring other interests.</p>

		<p>My favorite hobbies include <strong> coding, digital design, gaming (specifically league of legends), and stargazing </strong>! I'm not a professional nor an expert in any of these passions but I am looking to continue building up my experiences with projects and future career-related aspirations! Another thing I love to do for fun is <strong>writing articles and streaming on Twitch for the newly-made Annenberg Esports Media Center </strong> at USC. During my free time, I love hanging out with my friends and family and exploring cute cafes and boba shops while jamming to kpop.</p>

		<p>I <strong> graduated from a high school called BASIS Oro Valley in 2019</strong>. During high school, I built up on my leadership experience of being the <strong>first female president of Engineering Society</strong> and being <strong>president of National Honors Society</strong>. I also had an <strong> internship at NASA during senior year at the University of Arizona </strong> where I coded and translated raw data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft. One of my favorite memories during high school was winning Prom Queen which was a meaningful event for me due to the insecurity of being <strong> born with a cleft lip and palate </strong>. Since I was born, I went through at least ten palatoplasty surgeries to close the opening between the nose and mouth. You can check out my story below about why I think you should keep on smiling regardless of what you were born with! </p>
